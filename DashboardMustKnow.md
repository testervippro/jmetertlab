# Performance Test Result Analysis â€“ JMeter Focus

The main goal of performance testing is to evaluate how an application behaves under load and identify any performance issues. Accurate analysis is crucial because incorrect conclusions or a risky go-live decision can impact revenue, brand reputation, and user experience.

When analyzing JMeter test results, the key questions to ask are:

* How to read the JMeter graphs?
* How to correlate multiple metrics to find bottlenecks?
* How to conclude the results based on graphs and numbers?
* How to make a Go/No-Go decision for the application?

Below is a breakdown of the basic JMeter graphs and their interpretation:

---

## 1. User Graph (Active Threads Over Time)

**Purpose:** Shows the load pattern of virtual users during the test.

**Key information:**

* When the user load started.
* Ramp-up and ramp-down patterns.
* When steady-state load was achieved.
* How many threads (users) were active at a given time.
* When threads exited.

**JMeter Graph:** **Active Threads Over Time**

**Tip:** This graph is critical for validating that your load pattern matches the test plan.

## 2. Response Time Graph (Response Times Over Time)

**Purpose:** Shows how long requests and transactions take to complete.

**Types:**

* **Request response time:** Time for a single request.
* **Transaction response time:** Time to complete a group of requests defined as a transaction.

**Key metrics:**

* Average response time
* Min/Max response time
* Percentiles (90th, 95th, 99th)

**JMeter Graph:** **Response Times Over Time**

**Tip:** Compare response times with SLA thresholds to identify potential issues.

## 3. Throughput Graph (Bytes Throughput Over Time)

**Purpose:** Shows the amount of data sent from the server to the client per unit time.

**Key points:**

* Measured in bytes/sec, KB/sec, MB/sec.
* Drops in throughput can indicate network or server-side issues (e.g., connection pool, queuing).
* Combine with response time graph for deeper analysis.

## 4. Hits per Second Graph (Bytes Hits per Second)

**Purpose:** Measures the number of HTTP requests sent to the server per second.

**Key points:**

* Distinct from Transactions per Second (TPS).
* One transaction may involve multiple HTTP hits.
* High response times can reduce Hits per Second.

**JMeter Graph:** **Bytes Hits per Second**

**Tip:** Use this graph to ensure your request rate is consistent with expected load.

---

## 5. Transactions per Second Graph (Transactions per Second)

**Purpose:** Tracks how many transactions are executed per second.

**Key points:**

* Helps monitor TPS during live testing.
* High response times reduce TPS.
* Proper pacing in the test plan ensures SLA compliance.

**JMeter Graph:** **Transactions per Second**

---

## 6. Error Graph (Top 5 Errors by Sampler / Error Table)

**Purpose:** Shows the number and type of errors during the test.

**Key points:**

* Quantitative: number of errors over time.
* Descriptive: detailed error messages for root cause analysis.
* Combine with response time or throughput graphs to identify bottlenecks.

**JMeter Graphs:**

* **Top 5 Errors by Sampler**
* **Error Table**

### Summary

When analyzing **JMeter** test results:

1. Start by checking **Active Threads Over Time** to validate load patterns.
2. Review **Response Times Over Time** to see if performance meets SLA.
3. Analyze **Throughput** and **Hits per Second** to detect network/server issues.
4. Examine **Transactions per Second** for SLA compliance.
5. Investigate errors using **Error Table** or **Top 5 Errors**.
6. Merge insights from multiple graphs to identify root causes and bottlenecks.

This approach ensures your **Go/No-Go decision** is data-driven and reduces the risk of performance issues in production.
