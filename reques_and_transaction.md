Perfect 👍 Let’s write a **concrete JMeter test plan example** to prove the difference between **TPS and RPS**.

# ✅ Example JMeter Test Plan

### Test Structure

```
Thread Group (10 users, Ramp-up 1s, Loop Count forever, Duration 30s)
 ├── HTTP Request - "Login"    (Sampler 1)
 ├── HTTP Request - "Browse"   (Sampler 2)
 └── Transaction Controller - "Checkout Transaction"
        ├── HTTP Request - "Add to Cart"   (Sampler 3)
        ├── HTTP Request - "Payment"       (Sampler 4)
        └── HTTP Request - "Confirm Order" (Sampler 5)
```

### Explanation

* Each user executes 5 samplers:

  * 2 stand-alone requests (`Login`, `Browse`).
  * 1 transaction (`Checkout`), which contains 3 requests.
* So per iteration:

  * Requests = 5
  * Transactions = 3 (Login, Browse, Checkout group).

---

# 📊 What Happens When Running 10 Users for 30 Seconds?

### Requests per Second (RPS)

* Each user does 5 requests per loop.
* If each user can finish \~1 loop per second:

  * **RPS ≈ 10 users × 5 requests = 50 RPS**

### Transactions per Second (TPS)

* Each user finishes 3 transactions per loop (Login, Browse, Checkout).
* If each user can finish \~1 loop per second:

  * **TPS ≈ 10 users × 3 transactions = 30 TPS**

---

# 🔍 How to See in JMeter

1. Add **Aggregate Report** (shows Throughput → Requests/sec).

   * You’ll see \~50 RPS.
2. Add **Transactions per Second Listener (plugin)**.

   * You’ll see \~30 TPS.

---

# ✅ Result

* **Aggregate Report** throughput → \~50 requests/sec (RPS).
* **TPS Listener** → \~30 transactions/sec.

This proves that:

* **TPS < RPS** when Transaction Controllers group multiple requests.
* **TPS = RPS** when each sampler is considered a transaction.

👉 Do you want me to also **write the JMX XML code** of this test plan (so you can import directly into JMeter), or just keep it conceptual like above?
